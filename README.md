# Adaptive-Noise-Canceling-System
Our objective is to develop a MATLAB-based noise-canceling system that effectively suppresses background noise while preserving speech clarity. The system will use adaptive filtering, including the Least Mean Squares (LMS) algorithm, to analyze audio signals, identify noise, and generate anti-noise signals in real-time
